                    <p>Hi there! I am
                        Rizwan Rashid
                        <br>
                        A passionate programmer and a Coach, born and brought up in Bangladesh. I am a Full Stack Web
                        Developer with React.js, Redux, Express.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL as my tech stack.
                        In 2019, I successfully completed my Engineering with specialization in 'Electronics and
                        Telecommunication'.
                        Working with the clients, my goal is always driven towards providing amazing experience with the
                        best level of quality and service to them.
                        Along with that, I also help people as a COACH on their journey of becoming a professional
                        programmer.
                        I love learning about new technologies, what problems are they solving and How can I use them to
                        build better and scalable products.</p>
